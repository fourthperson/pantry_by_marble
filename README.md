This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

> **Note**: Normal readme will resume after this Pantry Setup section

## Pantry Setup
### 1.  Clone the repository from GitHub
In a terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/fourthperson/pantry_by_marble`
<br/>
This will create a new directory `pantry_by_marble`

### 2. Install dependencies
- In the same terminal window, run `cd pantry_by_marble` to get into the cloned directory from Step 1 above.
<br/>
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies specified in `package.json`. Wait for the command to complete.

##### iOS Setup
- Run `cd ios` to get into the iOS project.
- Run `pod install` to install iOS specific dependencies.
#### Assets Linkinkg
- Run `npx react-native-asset` to bundle assets. Wait for the command to complete.

### 3. Running the app
- Ensure you have either an android/ios emulator or physical device set up and running
- Run `yarn start` to start the Metro Server.
- Open another terminal window or tab.
- In the new terminal window run `yarn android` to run on Android or `yarn ios` to run on iOS
- Wait for the app to build and bundle the app. It will deploy on the device of the platform that you selected (android/ios)

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
